# Computer-Vision-Chain-Coding
Image object edge detection using Chain Code computer vision technique. 

# How to run:

## Input
Provide as input a command line argument that is a text file representing a greyscale image with a labeled connected component.
The first line of the file must be a header containing four integers corresponding to number of rows, number of columns, min val, and max value of input.

## Output
The program will generate two output files. 
1. A file with be the compressed input file expressed as a string of integers denoting the connected component's chain code.
2. A file is generated by decompressing the generated compressed file and highlighting the boundary of the connected component using only the chain code.
